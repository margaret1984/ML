# ML
series of scripts I used for my project "machine learning prediction of treatment outcomes in depression".
Scripts include:
1) Feature selection using LASSO penalize regression and correlation adjusted T scores (CAT) in cross-validation and repeated CV
2) Getting summary statistics for CV
3) Fitting model on a non-overlapping set of held-out data
